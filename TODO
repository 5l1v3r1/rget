## PR+1 - All file GH Release Test

Use: Prove that the sha256sum can support all files for a given release

- Introduce database to hold onto sha256sum info and index to org/project/release tuple

## MVP+3 - All digests for a Docker image

Use: Prove that the scheme works for docker images as well


## Public Release
- Index top NNN docker images and github repos into the service

# Lessons Learned

- Let's encrypt requires a CN that is shorter than 64 bytes. Thus 5c793eed08df469f8a40a0465f767677.secured.ifup.org
- Github has multiple URLs for the same release tarball depending on API or website lookup


# Nice to have

- Save OAUTH token for github into a config file

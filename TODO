# MVP

## MVP - Single File GH Release Test

Use: Create a certificate for the tar ball release of a GitHub release only.
Proof points:
x Create sub commands via cobra
x Sha256sum generation from GitHub
x Git log for sha files generated from Github
x Webservice serving up sha files for wildcard domain from git
x Request/issue Let's Encrypt certificate
x Check CT log entry on crt.sh via a subcommand
x Verify CT log entry in program via a subcommand
- Verify file URL SHA256Sum is in SHA256Sum returned by server
- Verify SHA256Sum value matches domain merkle root

## MVP+1 - All file GH Release Test

Use: Prove that the sha256sum can support all files for a given release

- Introduce database to hold onto sha256sum info and index to org/project/release tuple

## MVP+2 - All digests for a Docker image

Use: Prove that the scheme works for docker images as well

# Public Release

## Public Release

- Index top NNN docker images and github repos into the service
- Define roadmap for self-hosting
- Define well-known URL for discovering domain for release discovery for a domain

# Lessons Learned

- Let's encrypt requires a CN that is shorter than 64 bytes. Thus 5c793eed08df469f8a40a0465f767677.secured.ifup.org
- Github has multiple URLs for the same release tarball depending on API or website lookup
